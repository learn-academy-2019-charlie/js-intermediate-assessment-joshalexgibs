# Intermediate Javascript Assessments

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

.map() is useful for accessing and altering each element found in the provided array, otherwise simply looping through the array.
.filter() functions much the same, but will prune an array, keeping elements that match a condition and excludes the rest.

2. Why would you use object destructuring?

Object destructuring is useful for simplifying code when making multiple calls to a state element, making code cleaner and easier to read.

3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

var is used to declare a variable with a global scope.
let is used to declare a variable with limited scope, keeping it in any loop or function it was called in.
const is used to declare a constant, unable to be altered after declaration.

4. Why is testing important?

It ensures that each individual component or function performs as intended before moving on to the next bit of code to be written.
Also returns a clearer reason why an error occurred, compared to what returns through a console.log().

5. What is a higher order function?

A higher order function is one that takes in or returns another function.

6. What is the difference between a class and an object?

An object is a container for key:value data pairs, whereas classes are a combination of behaviour and objects.//fix
